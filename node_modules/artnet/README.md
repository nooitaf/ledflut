# artnet

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/artnet.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/artnet)

This is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) module that can be used to send ArtDMX packages to an [Art-Net](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art-Net) node.

## Usage

connect, set channel 1 to 255, disconnect.
```javascript
var options = {
    host: '172.16.23.15'
}

var artnet = require('artnet')(options);

// set channel 1 to 255 and disconnect afterwards.
artnet.set(1, 255, function (err, res) {
    artnet.close();
});
```

The set method can set multiple channels at once:

Use an array to set subsequent channels...
```javascript
// set channel 100 to 10, channel 101 to 20 and channel 102 to 30
artnet.set(100, [10, 20, 30]); 
```

...if you want to keep certain channels unchanged set them to null
```javascript
// set channel 50 to 255 and channel 52 to 127
artnet.set(50, [255, null, 127]);
```

you can omit the channel, it defaults to 1
```javascript
// Set channel 1 to 255 and channel 2 to 127:
artnet.set([255, 127]);
```

This lib throttles the maximum send rate to ~40Hz. Unchanged data is refreshed every ~4s.

## Options

  * host (Default ```"255.255.255.255"```)
  * port (Default ```6454```)
  * refresh (millisecond interval for sending unchanged data to the Art-Net node. Default ```4000```)
  * iface (optional string IP address - bind udp socket to specific network interface)

## Methods

#### **set(** [ [ *uint15* **universe** , ] *uint9* **channel** , ] *uint8* **value** [ , *function(err, res)* **callback** ] **)**
#### **set(** [ [ *uint15* **universe** , ] *uint9* **channel** , ] *array[uint8]* **values** [ , *function(err, res)* **callback** ] **)**


Every parameter except the value(s) is optional. If you supply a universe you need to supply the channel also.
Defaults: universe = 0, channel = 1

Callback is called with (error, response) params.
If error and response are null data remained unchanged and therefore nothing has been sent.


#### **close( )**

Closes the connection and stops the send interval.


#### **setHost( *string* **host** )**

Change the Art-Net hostname/address after initialization
